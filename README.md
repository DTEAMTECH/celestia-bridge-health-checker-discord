     sudo systemctl restart celestia-bridge
     ```
   - Testnet:
     ```bash
     sed -i '/\[RPC\]/,/^\[/ s/Address = "localhost"/Address = "0.0.0.0"/' $HOME/.celestia-bridge-mocha-4/config.toml
     sudo systemctl restart celestia-bridge
     ```

2. Retrieve your node data:
   - IP:
     ```bash
     hostname -I
     ```
   - Port:
     ```bash
     awk -F' = ' '/\[RPC\]/ {flag=1; next} flag && /Port/ {gsub(/"/, "", $2); print $2; exit}'
     ```
